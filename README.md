# AVR8js

This is a JavaScript library that implementats the AVR 8-bit architecture.

It's the heart- but not the whole body- of the Arduino simulator at [https://wokwi.com](https://wokwi.com).

## Example Applications Using `AVR8js`

* [Wokwi Arduino Simulator](https://wokwi.com) - Arduino simulator with a choice of hardware that can be wired up dynamically in your browser!
* [avr8js-electron playground](https://github.com/arcostasi/avr8js-electron-playground) - a Downloadable Electron Arduino simulator app
* [AVR8js-Falstad](https://markmegarry.github.io/AVR8js-Falstad/) - combining the Falstad circuit simulator with AVR8js!
* [The Engineering Physics Department of Dawson College's Arduino Course](https://tawjaw.github.io/Arduino-Robot-Virtual-Lab/) - an introduction to Arduino with a focus on robotics

## How to Use This Library

This library only implements the AVR CPU core. 
You have to supply it pre-compiled machine code to run, and implement functional simulations of any external hardware. You will probably also want to add  audio/visual representations of external hardware being simulated.

A rough conceptual diagram:

```
Pre-Compiled machine code --> AVR8js <--> Glue code <--> external hardware functional simulation <--> simulation state display for the user
```
You may be interested in exploring the [wokwi-elements](https://github.com/wokwi/wokwi-elements) collection of web-components for visual representations of many common hardware components. (Note: these are visual only elements- you will need to add the appropriate functional simulation and glue code.)

### Unofficial examples

These examples show working examples of using `avr8js` in an application. Many of them also demonstrate how to use the `wokwi-elements` and include working examples of functional simulations of the components, and how to hook them up to `avr8js`.

## Running the demo project

The demo project allows you to edit Arduino code, compile it, and run it in the simulator.
It also simulates 2 LEDs connected to pins 12 and 13 (PB4 and PB5). 

To run the demo project, check out this repository, run `npm install` and then `npm start`.

## Which chips can be simulated?

The library focuses on simulating the *ATmega328p*, which is the MCU used by the Arduino Uno.

However, the code is built in a modular way, and is highly configurable, making it possible
to simulate many chips from the AVR8 family, such as the ATmega2560 and the ATtiny series:
